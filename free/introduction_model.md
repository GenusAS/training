#Analysis and Data Mart introduction

The data model in this course is only comprised of tree object classes:

* Activity
* Person
* Department

The application is being used to keep track of current sales and HR activities. The product owner, Burt McBoss, has asked you to expand the application, and make interfaces available on the web. As a Business Engineer, you will be involved in the entire process, from data model design, to business logic and user interface.
