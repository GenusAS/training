# Installation of SQL Server Management Studio

To be able to develop/model in Genus Apps, you often have to create new tables and columns in the associated database. For this you will need SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on your computer.

If you for some reason don't want to (or are not allowed to) install SSMS on your computer, you will find one in the training room on which you can run your SQL queries, or you can ask the instructor to run them for you. That being said, we do recommend you to install it on your own computer if possible.

## Download the latest release of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms . 
*After installation, launch SSMS and create a new connection with connection string "genus-edu.database.windows.net,1458". (Note: The same connection string is used for all environments as all databases are located on the same database server):

You will be provided a user name and password, please ask the instructor if you have not received one already. All queries will be run against your  database edu_db_data{X}. After login, you will have to click on "New Query" and select the correct database in the box located in upper left corner:
