# User Interface in Genus Apps: Forms, Tables and Ribbon
**SESSION BY INSTRUCTOR:** *The instructor will give you a brief introduction to the creation of Forms and Tables in Genus. Notify the instructor if you have reached this point before the session.*

You have made the object Contact, but still it is not possible for the end user to see or register them. For that to happen, you must add Contacts to the user interface. Read the following information about user interface in Genus before you do the next exercise:

In Genus Apps there are two main constrcutions that is used to show information; Tables and Forms. Both Tables and Forms kan use Ribbon. A Ribbon is a command line situated at the top of the window which shows functionality relevant to the content.

##Table 
Tables are used to display simple lists or aggregated lists of data. One can do searches in them or apply various filters. Tables are typically placed in the Navigation Pane on the left-hand side of the client, e.g. "Customers" in Genus CRM.
Tables can also be "plugged" into Forms (e.g. list Contacts associated with a Company), but for this purpose, Forms also has its own control (Grid) which is quicker to set up. However, if an object is going to be listed in several Forms, a Table may be the preferred solution (as you can reuse it).

##Forms 
Forms are tailor-made displays that can show fields, lists, buttons, file-previews, etc., almost without limitations in terms of layout (a bunch of traditional and "bleeding edge" layout controls are available). Forms can be used to show data from one or multiple objects together in the same view. One can also switch between different views (to create "wizard"-like functionality). A Form can be customized to Desktop or Apps - the latter implies that you model a whole platform independent mobile app or website in Genus Studio.

Forms can, in their simplest form, be a display of one single object (e.g. display details about 1 contact person), but they can also be fairly advanced and based on Use Cases, e.g. big displays for managing activities with lists, warnings, buttons, detail information and previews in the same window.

Within a Form, there are two constructions for listing objects: Grid and Table. The latter is a reference to an existing table (i.e. you would probably want to use this option if you want to list the same object in many forms - due to maintenance and reuse), while the former is set up per Form (i.e. you can customize column selections and available actions per Form - this demands more work / maintanance if you want to show the same list several places)

##Ribbon
Both Forms and Tables can get a user friendly menu structure through Ribbon. A Ribbon is a menu structure that most users are familiar with and see every day in Microsoft Office-products and in their operating system (Windows 10). Commands can be run from the Ribbon, and one can use Context to show different menu elements for different parts of the interface (when navigating).
 
The exercises concerning user interface are not as detailed as those concerning the rest of the modeling. Hence, you are free to define much of the solution's appearance yourself.
