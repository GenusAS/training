# Installation of Genus Apps and URLs to the environments

1.	In case you haven't installed Genus Apps on your computer yet: Open the web browser and type http://edufasit.genus.net/GenusCRM/Download/Setup.exe . This will download Genus Apps.
2.	An environment will be assigned to you. We have 16 environments: 
    
    edu1a, edu1b, .., edu1h samt edu2a, edu2b, .., edu2h. 
    
	You will be doing all your training exercises in the assigned environment. In addition, you will get access to a solution, which can be used to verify your work or give inspiration when needed (please make sure you are not editing the solution!).
3.	Create 4 shortcuts on your computer with the targets below. Note that "1a" must be replaced with the environment number assigned to you (i.e. change «edu1a» to «edu2b» if your assigned environment is 2b).
  * “genusstudiolink:http://edu1.genus.net/edu1a/?LinkType=OpenStudio” 
(Navn: Genus CRM Edu1a Studio)
 “genuslink:http://edu1.genus.net/edu1a/?RunAsAdmin=1” 
(Navn: Genus CRM Edu1a)
  * “genusstudiolink:http://edufasit.genus.net/GenusCRM/?LinkType=OpenStudio” 
(Navn: Genus CRM Solution Studio)
  * “genuslink:http://edufasit.genus.net/GenusCRM/” 
(Navn: Genus CRM Solution)

The first shortcut points to the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) of our developing tool Genus Studio. The second shortcut points to the end user application (also referred to as the client or Genus Desktop. Shortcuts 3 and 4 are the equivalents for the provided solution.

**Login credentials for your own solution:**

username / password = usrXY / usrusr.

where XY is the number of your assigned environment (i.e. if you got edu1a, your username / password are usr1a / usrusr, respectively).

The same username and password can be used to access the provided solution.
