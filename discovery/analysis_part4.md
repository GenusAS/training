# Analysis Part Four - Advanced analysis 

### SESSION BY INSTRUCTOR: 
In this section the participants will learn how to use more advanced analysis techniques by visualizing data using the **Sankey** and **Map** tools.

#### Agenda 

- Sankey
- Map
	- GeoJSON
	- Heat spots (Coming soon!)
	- Vector layer (Coming soon!)

## Exercise

Try to recreate the analysis shown in class in the solution environment. 	
	
### Sankey
