# Installation of Genus Apps and URLs to the environments

### Installation
In case you haven't installed Genus Apps on your computer yet: Open the web browser and type http://edudiscovery.genus.net/discover/Download/Setup.exe . This will download Genus Apps.	

### Environments
An environment will be assigned to you. We have 15 environments: 

user1a, user1b, .., user1g and user2a, user2b, .., user2h.     

You will be doing all your training exercises in the assigned environment. In each environment there are also solution analysis and data marts, which can be used to verify your work or give inspiration when needed (please make sure you are not editing the solution!).

### Shortcuts to access environments
Create two shortcuts on your computer with the targets below. Note that the number in your username indicates which environment you will use. I.e. "user1a" will use environment 1 while "user2b" indicates environment 2. 
  * Environment 1 “genusstudiolink:http://edudiscovery.genus.net/discover/?LinkType=OpenStudio” 
  * Environment 2 “genusstudiolink:http://edudiscovery2.genus.net/discover/?LinkType=OpenStudio” 
   (Navn: Genus Discovery Studio)
 * Environment 1 “genuslink:http://edudiscovery.genus.net/discover/?RunAsAdmin=1” 
 * Environment 2 “genuslink:http://edudiscovery2.genus.net/discover/?RunAsAdmin=1”  
   (Navn: Genus Discovery)


The first shortcut points to the developing tool Genus Studio. The second shortcut points to the end user application (also referred to as the client or Genus Desktop). 

**Login credentials for your own solution**

username = userXY 
password = usrusr

where XY is the number of your assigned environment (i.e. if you got user1a, your username / password are user1a / usrusr, respectively).
